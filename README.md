Final Project

This is a Connect N game that allows the user to pick from 4-9 pieces. The instructions are included on the right hand side of the upper panel. To start the game hover the mouse over the middle of the GUI and a "Start" button will pop up. Simpy click on that and you will be able to input your name, number of pieces necessary to win, and start the game.
